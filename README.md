if __name__ == "__main__":
    while True:
        question = input("Are you sure you want to insert fictional data into the database? [Y/N] ")
        if question.upper() == "Y":
            try:
                simulation()
            except Exception as error:
                print(error)
            else:
                print("Data entered successfully.")
                
                logging.basicConfig(
                    level=logging.INFO,
                    format="%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s",
                    filename="log/log.log"
                )
                logging.warning('Fictitious data was added to the database by test file "test_simulation.py"')
            break
        elif question.upper() == "N":
